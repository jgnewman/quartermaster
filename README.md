# quartermaster
A shared component library

## Todo
- Confirm the repo can be installed and that files can be imported like `from "quartermaster/Button"
- Figure out how to publish with semantic releases or whatever
- Create new components
- Pick correct real deps and peer deps (ex: react, styled-components)
